### Tentative project idea #1 <br>
I would like to create a project that allows users to track their carbon footprint. With this project, I hope to increase awareness about people's consumption and motivate people to implement simple and greener practices in their everyday lives to help mitigate the climate change problem. Through my user research and contextual inquiry, I hope to find and implement some unique aspect or feature to help motivate and encourage a change in behaviour and mindset <br> <br>
