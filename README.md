### Tentative Project Idea #1 <br>
I would like to create a project that allows users to track their carbon footprint. With this project, I hope to increase awareness about people's consumption and motivate people to implement simple and greener practices in their everyday lives to help mitigate the climate change problem. Through my user research and contextual inquiry, I hope to find and implement some unique aspect or feature to help motivate and encourage a change in behaviour and mindset <br> <br> 

### Updated Project
Our current society renders technology as an indispensable tool to our daily personal and professional lives. It has enabled us to streamline our workflow processes, instantly connect with people across the world, and live very efficient and informed lifestyles. Our digital consumption becomes an intangible concept that is hard to grasp as we carry over our out of sight, out of mind mentality of physical resource consumption. <br> <br> 

The issue with our current dependency on technology to  daily routines is that our conception and understanding of our consumption takes on a out of sight, out of mind mentality. Especially in a western, developed society, we lose touch with how much waste we are producing, and how much water and energy we consume daily. More than ever today is the need to raise awareness and combat climate change. <br> <br> 

Green Track is a browser extension that will track your email's subscription lists and report data that will help users understand their inbox usage and maximize their productivity. It will report on the user's digital carbon footprint to raise awareness to help make digital consumption a tangible concept to users, and to provide an easy solution to reduce their carbon footprint.
